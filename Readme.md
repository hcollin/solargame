 
# "Solar Expanse" Game

A multiplayer strategy game for web and mobile.



## Idea list

These ideas are guidelines for the game design and making itself. Some of them are very broad thematic ideas and some detailed nuances.

### Environment and theme

* Game takes place in our solar system before the year 2100
  * This makes all the tech at least somewhat relatable and understandable for current generation
  * Game is played more on the ground level and starships themselves are expensive.
* Players are not nations, but heads of corporations and organizations each with their own agendas
  * Each player can design their own corp at the beginning of the game with distinct end goals
    * Goals can be financial, political, military, technological or even social 
  * Open warfare should be really rare between players, but shadowy tactical strikes (especially in the outer rims of the solar system) are more common
    * Nations of the game would not tolerate openly massive private armies
  * The players themselves can be targeted as they have representation in the game world
    * Permanent death is a thing for the character, but player can continue playing by the new CEO/Cult leader what ever.



### Gameplay mechanics

 * Each turn is considered to be 1 month.
    * There is no limit of turns the game takes, but it should be optimized to be between 25 and 50.

#### Action points 

 * Each player has certain amounts of Action Points for each turn which allows them to give a limited amount commands to areas, units etc.
   * Giving orders to units/buildings/areas in the planet that the player is physically located in is far cheaper than trying to micromanage a ship in other edge of the solar system
 * Each player can hire subordinates (managers/generals/scientists/captains/engineers etc) that they can give instructions cheaper than actually commanding units directly and so on.
  * These subordinates can have their own hirelings working on certain buildings etc

#### Map and Areas

* Each planet/moon/asteroid is has two or more areas.
  * At least one of the areas is the orbit and at least on is the surface.
  * Each area can have the presense of multiple players. Acts of combat must be initiated with commands (or by over zealos generals)

#### Units and combat

* Surface Units are tied to bases that are built on areas and some units (like flying units) can have reach of multiple areas which they defend automatically. 
  * Although unit may have reach for multiple areas, it cannot be everywhere at once and units have limited of engagements they can participate each turn.
* Space combat units must have some sort of carrier/base also in the orbit. This can be a ship or space station. 
  * Further in the tech field units that can operate both in the surface and in the orbit may be available.

#### Technology

* Technological research is done mainly by focusing on certainn fields (like physics, biology, economics, politics, computing, etc).
  * Most of the time this research will increase the effectiveness of current tech until they reach their ceiling
  * 


#### Economy


#### Politics

 * Political voting for new laws/actions/rules happens in a bit separate cycle
   * Each player can suggest for one (maybe more later) law/action/rule for each political phase, 
   * In the preliminary voting players will vote which 3 laws/actions/rules will go into the main voting phase that happens two turns later
   * In the main voting phase each player can vote for each of the three laws/rules/actions and then the cycle begins again.
   * Main voting phase will be in every sixth turn.
   * Players may also abstain on 1 law/rule/action for each main voting phase (maybe)
 * Some suggestions for laws etc. are placed by neutral factions and they will also vote during the main voting phase 
   * Players can try to persuade neutral factions to vote in their way.
